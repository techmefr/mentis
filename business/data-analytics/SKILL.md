# data-analytics

Business layer (`business/README.md`). For the mechanics of writing SQL well, defer to whatever
stack skill applies (`skills/*-conventions`, a query tool); this block is about the shape of the
data *landscape* itself — the thing that has to be understood correctly before a query is safe to
trust.

**This is not a substitute for the company's own data engineering expertise.** It's the set of
questions and defaults that keep an AI-assisted query from being confidently wrong about a landscape
it can't see in full. Where the company has a documented schema, a data dictionary or a governance
policy, that wins outright.

**Applying an override is silent.** Write what the company's own documentation or governance policy
requires and move on — never report "a conflict between mentis and the house rules" to whoever's
watching. Surface it as a specific, named question only when no rule anywhere actually resolves the
case.

## When
As soon as a task touches reporting, a dashboard, a KPI, an extraction or a consolidation across more
than one data source — before the first query is written, not after it returns a plausible-looking
number.

## Steps

**Read only the sections the task actually touches.** The rules live one file per section under
`references/`; §1 comes first on any task, §4 applies to all of them, and §2, §3 and §5 are read when
the task is documentation, a consolidation or a metric. `agents/oracle` reads them §-by-§ in that
order.

| § | Covers | Read it when | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Map the landscape before querying it | always, before the first query | [`01-landscape.md`](./references/01-landscape.md) |
| 2 | Usage guide, not schema dump | writing down what a table is for, or judging an existing note | [`02-usage-guide.md`](./references/02-usage-guide.md) |
| 3 | Consolidation across independent instances | a figure has to span several per-entity databases | [`03-consolidation.md`](./references/03-consolidation.md) |
| 4 | Data-handling invariants | any task that reads real data | [`04-invariants.md`](./references/04-invariants.md) |
| 5 | KPI and dashboard discipline | a metric or a dashboard is proposed, defined or reviewed | [`05-kpi-dashboard.md`](./references/05-kpi-dashboard.md) |

## Output / checkpoint
No pipeline checkpoint (business layer, see `business/README.md`). What it owes: the landscape mapped
(§1) before the first query, a usage-guide-shaped note on any table whose role isn't obvious, the
consolidation tradeoff named explicitly when a `UNION ALL`-shaped fix is proposed, every number
traceable to the table and logic that produced it, and — for a KPI or dashboard — a written definition
(§5.1) that survives being questioned a month later.

## Guardrails
- Never treat an identifier as portable across independent per-entity/per-tenant instances of the same
  schema without checking (§1.2).
- Never present a fragile hand-maintained consolidation view as a permanent architecture without
  naming its maintenance and performance cost (§3.1).
- Never write to a system of record to answer a reporting question (§4.1).
- Never substitute a default for a missing value to make a number look complete (§4.2).
- Never put a metric on a decision-making dashboard without running the decision test (§5.2) first.
- Never let the same business term be computed two different ways in two places without flagging it —
  that's the single-source-of-truth rule (§5.3), and it's cheaper to fix before both numbers ship.
- Never guess at a company's data governance, retention or access-control policy (§4.10) — ask the team
  that owns the data landscape, the same way `business/data-protection` routes lawful-basis questions
  to a DPO rather than answering them.
- This block has no dedicated in-house data-engineering expertise behind it yet: a solid set of
  defaults, not proven doctrine, to be confronted with a real analytics engagement.

Generalised from the org catalogue's two BI landscape skills, plus public sources for the layered
modeling, the data-quality vocabulary and the KPI discipline. The full provenance and the refresh log
