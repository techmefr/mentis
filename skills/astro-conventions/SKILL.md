# astro-conventions

Step 6 of the pipeline (`WORKFLOW.md`), for the content-first, islands-based web framework. **Status: a base to
confront with real work**, no in-house project behind it yet (same status as `go-conventions`). Pinned to the
Astro documentation read on 2026-10-02 from the default branch (latest release on the package registry that day:
7.3.5); items marked `[verify]` were introduced in a version the reader must confirm is the one installed. The UI
framework used inside islands (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid) has its own block; the bundler under it is
`skills/vite-bundler-conventions`.

## When
As soon as an `.astro` file, `astro.config.*`, a content collection, middleware, an action or an endpoint is
written or modified, during `code` (6) and `review` (8).

## Steps

### 1. Rendering mode
1. **The default is a fully prerendered site.** Pages, routes and endpoints are rendered to static files at build
   time. Opt a route out with `export const prerender = false` (this needs a server adapter), or switch the whole
   project to `output: 'server'` and opt routes in. Choose per route: a page reading cookies or per-request data is
   on demand; a marketing page is not.
2. **Cookies, headers, sessions and the request-time APIs exist only on demand.** In a prerendered page they run
   at build time. Middleware runs at build time for prerendered pages and at request time otherwise.
3. **An adapter is required** for on-demand pages and for server islands; the platform's adapter may also enable
   image and caching services even for a static site.

### 2. Islands
1. **Astro components render to HTML with no client runtime.** A framework component (React, Vue, Svelte, …) ships
   no JavaScript to the browser unless it carries a `client:*` directive; the directive makes it a client island,
   hydrated separately from the rest of the page. Do not add a directive "to be safe".
2. **Pick the lowest priority that works.** `client:load` hydrates at once (immediately visible, immediately
   interactive); `client:idle` when the browser is idle (optional `timeout`); `client:visible` when it enters the
   viewport (optional `rootMargin` to hydrate slightly early and limit layout shift); `client:media` when a CSS
   media query matches; `client:only="framework"` skips server rendering entirely, so there is no HTML for
   crawlers or first paint: give a `slot="fallback"` and name the framework.
3. **Islands are independent**; share state between them with a store or events, not through the page. Several
   frameworks may coexist on a page; each costs its runtime, so mix only with a reason.
4. **Server islands** (`server:defer`, adapter needed) render a component on demand outside the page render: the
   page ships at once with its fallback slot, and the personal part (a profile picture from a cookie) arrives
   after, which lets the rest be cached hard. Props must be serialisable; functions and circular objects cannot be
   passed.

### 3. Scripts, styles and HTML
1. **A plain `<script>` in an `.astro` file is processed**: bundled, TypeScript-capable, typed as a module, deduplicated
   across components (included once per page, so attach listeners with a query over all matches rather than by
   id), and inlined when small. `is:inline` opts out; scripts outside `src/` also need it.
2. **Component styles are scoped by default**; `is:global` opts out. Prefer scoped styles and name a global style
   deliberately.
3. **`set:html` injects a raw HTML string like `innerHTML`; `set:text` escapes.** Use `set:html` only on trusted
   or sanitised content (a CMS field you control is still content; sanitise it). The JSON-LD case
   (`set:html={JSON.stringify(...)}` on a script tag) is the legitimate use.

### 4. Environment and secrets
1. **Only variables prefixed `PUBLIC_` reach client code**; every variable is available on the server. A secret
   never carries the prefix. Plain `import.meta.env` values are statically replaced at build time by the underlying
   bundler; under on-demand rendering, runtime reads depend on the adapter (usually `process.env`, not on every
   platform), which the type-safe schema API abstracts.
2. **Declare variables in the environment schema** (`astro:env`, `envField`) with a context (client or server)
   and an access (public or secret). Public client variables end up in client and server bundles; secret server
   variables stay out of the bundle and are read on the server; a secret client variable is not allowed because
   there is no safe way to send it. Secrets are validated when the server module is first imported, or at start
   with `validateSecrets`. In `astro.config`, `import.meta.env` does not see `.env` files: use `process.env` for
   variables set outside, or the bundler's `loadEnv` helper.
3. **Use `import.meta.env`, not `process.env`**, in Astro code; branch on `DEV`/`PROD`, never on a copy.

### 5. Content collections
1. **Content that is a set of similar items is a collection** with a loader (the built-in file/glob loaders, a
   community loader, or your own) and a schema that validates every entry and types the queries. Without a
   schema the types and the validation are lost.
2. **Query with `getCollection()` and `getEntry()`**, not by globbing imports. Build-time collections are right
   when content changes at deploy time; **live collections** (queried at request time) cost performance and have
   fewer features: use them only for data that must be current.
3. **Do not make a collection for a handful of one-off pages**, or for a source with its own client library that
   offers no loader and that you would rather call directly.

### 6. Server code
1. **Middleware** exports a named `onRequest(context, next)` from the middleware file (not a default export),
   shares request data through `context.locals`, and runs for every on-demand request; compose several with the
   `sequence` helper. Keep `locals` free of secrets that a template might print.
2. **Actions** (`defineAction`) are typed server functions with validated input (a schema; JSON by default, form
   data when `accept: 'form'`). Return data; throw the library's action error for expected failures (not found,
   unauthorised) instead of returning `undefined`. Check the caller's authorisation inside the handler: an action
   is a public endpoint, reachable under a path derived from its name (the documentation says so; the rule to
   authorise inside is ours).
3. **CSRF**: on-demand pages check that the `Origin` header matches the request for `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` and
   `PUT` with form content types, and answer 403 otherwise. It is on by default. Turning it off
   (`security.checkOrigin: false`) needs a stated reason; behind a proxy, the `allowedDomains` option makes Astro
   trust the forwarded host header only when it matches a listed pattern, which guards against host-header
   injection (it is about `Astro.url`, not a replacement for the origin check).
4. **Endpoints** return a `Response`; validate input as for any boundary (`skills/security-hardening`).

## Output / checkpoint
A route-by-route statement of its rendering mode; the `client:*` directive of each island with its reason; the
env schema; the collection schemas. No dedicated checkpoint: `gate` (7) and `review` (8).

## Guardrails
No comments in the code produced. Never an install: name the package, the person runs `pnpm add <package>`
(`CONVENTIONS.md`). Never a secret behind `PUBLIC_`. Never `set:html` on unsanitised input. Never a `client:*`
directive without a reason. A rule with a number or a default is the pinned major's; read `package.json` before
applying it to another.

## Mechanical checks

```
grep -rnE "client:(load|idle|visible|media|only)" src
grep -rnE "set:html" src
grep -rnE "PUBLIC_[A-Z_]*(SECRET|KEY|TOKEN|PASSWORD)" .env* src
grep -rnE "export const prerender" src
grep -rnE "checkOrigin" astro.config.*
grep -rnE "process\.env" src
grep -rnE "getCollection|getLiveCollection|import\.meta\.glob" src
grep -rnE "export default" src/middleware.*
```

- A `client:load` on an island below the fold is a candidate for `visible`; a `client:only` with no fallback
  hurts first paint and crawlers.
- A secret-looking name behind `PUBLIC_` is a finding even with a placeholder value.

## Origin
Rewritten from the official Astro documentation (the `withastro/docs` repository, `src/content/docs/en`, MIT
licence), read from a shallow clone of the default branch on 2026-10-02: the islands concept page, rendering
(on-demand rendering and output), the directives reference, client-side scripts, environment variables and the
`astro:env` module, content collections, middleware, actions, server islands, and the security options of the
configuration reference. Mechanisms and defaults are the framework's; grouping and wording are ours; no text was
copied. **Facts that move, with their pin (Astro 7 documentation):** the client directive set, the origin-check
default and its content types, the live collection limits, the server-island serialisable types, the adapter
requirement. **Not read, a stated gap:** images and fonts, view transitions and prefetch, internationalisation,
routing details, sessions, the caching page, the deployment guides, testing, and any UI-framework integration;
nothing about them was written. Refresh with `skills/source-freshness` on the next major. Written 2026-10-02,
never run on real work.
