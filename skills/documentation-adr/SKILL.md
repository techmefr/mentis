# documentation-adr

Step 3 of the pipeline (`WORKFLOW.md`, after `archi`), for any significant decision that is
expensive to undo: not for documenting every minor choice. Every rule below holds in a repo with
**nothing installed** (`CONVENTIONS.md`, rule A).

## When
After `archi` (3), as soon as a structural decision is taken (choice of a technology, of a
migration pattern, of a boundary between modules): never for a local, easily reversible choice.

**An ADR is not written unprompted.** A significant decision is *proposed* as an ADR — its six
fields, in the chat reply or the PR description — never *committed as a new file* on your own
initiative. Writing the file is triggered by one of: the user explicitly asks for it; the project
already has an established ADR practice (an existing `docs/adr/`-shaped folder, or a house
convention naming one); or the user accepts the proposal. A repo with a documentation policy that
treats an unsolicited doc file as a defect (`no-project-docs`-shaped: code and commit/PR messages
carry the explanation, not a prose file nobody asked for) is the default case to assume absent a
signal otherwise, not the exception.

**Applying an override is silent.** Where a repo's own documentation policy governs, write what it
requires and move on — never report "a conflict between mentis and the house rules" to whoever's
watching. Surface it as a specific, named question only when no rule anywhere resolves the case.

## Steps

**Read only the section the task actually needs.** The rules live one file per section under
`references/`; §1 decides which kind of document this is, §2 is the template, §3 applies when a
recorded decision changes, and §4 is the one sentence a held tension needs.

| § | Covers | Read it when | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tell the three types of documentation apart | before writing anything down | [`01-three-types.md`](./references/01-three-types.md) |
| 2 | The six fields, always the same | proposing an ADR, or reviewing a written one | [`02-template.md`](./references/02-template.md) |
| 3 | Never delete, always supersede | a recorded decision is changed, reversed or has stopped being true | [`03-supersede.md`](./references/03-supersede.md) |
| 4 | Say when a trade-off is permanent | the decision holds a tension rather than resolving one | [`04-permanent-tradeoff.md`](./references/04-permanent-tradeoff.md) |

## Output / checkpoint
Every significant decision from the `archi` step has its six fields **proposed**, in chat or the PR
description; an ADR **file** exists only where writing one was actually triggered (see `## When`),
and where it does, never a field left empty "to go faster" (§2.7).

## Guardrails
Don't write an ADR for a trivial/reversible choice: reserved for decisions that are expensive to
undo. **Don't create the file on your own initiative** — propose it, and let an explicit ask, an
existing ADR folder, or acceptance of the proposal be what actually creates it; a repo's own
no-unsolicited-docs policy, where one exists, wins over this block's default. **Never delete a record
and never edit a decision in place** (§3.1, §3.6). Stay publishable (rule C): an ADR contains no secret
and no client name, only the technical decision.

A rewrite of a market generalist catalogue's `documentation-and-adrs` skill, with §4 reduced from a
market `preserving-productive-tensions` skill. The full provenance, the 2026-08-11 correction against
