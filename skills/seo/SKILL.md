# seo

Step 6 of the pipeline (`WORKFLOW.md`), complementing
`vue-nuxt-vuetify-conventions`/`react-nextjs-conventions`: applies only to pages meant to be indexed
by a search engine (not to back-offices, authenticated internal apps, or dashboards). The rules follow
the web standards and the search engines' published guidance, not any assistant or tool.

## When
As soon as a frontend page is public and has to be findable through search: during `code` (6) or at
review time (`review`, 8) if the diff touches public pages.

## Steps

**Read the sections the task touches.** One file per section under `references/`; a single public page diff
is usually §1 to §4, a launch or a migration adds §5, and a page with structured data, a published date or
a share card adds §6.

| § | Covers | Read it when | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Meta and indexing: title, description, canonical, robots, social tags, `hreflang` | any public page | [`01-meta-indexing.md`](./references/01-meta-indexing.md) |
| 2 | HTML semantics a crawler and a screen reader share | headings, links, images, or content reaching the HTML | [`02-html-semantics.md`](./references/02-html-semantics.md) |
| 3 | Core Web Vitals | the largest element, image sizing, main interactions | [`03-core-web-vitals.md`](./references/03-core-web-vitals.md) |
| 4 | Structured data, sitemap and URL shape at the page level | a page type could carry structured data, or sitemap, robots or URLs change | [`04-structured-sitemap-urls.md`](./references/04-structured-sitemap-urls.md) |
| 5 | Crawl and index health of a built site: statuses, redirects, canonical and directive conflicts, sitemap, link graph, URL form | before a launch or migration, a URL change, or a site audit | [`05-crawl-health.md`](./references/05-crawl-health.md) |
| 6 | Structured data types, dates and social previews | JSON-LD is added, a date or an author is published, or a page is meant to be shared | [`06-structured-data-social.md`](./references/06-structured-data-social.md) |
| 7 | Content trust signals and local presence | a site publishes advice or articles, a sensitive subject, or a physical location | [`07-content-trust-local.md`](./references/07-content-trust-local.md) |

## Output / checkpoint
The sections reviewed on the diff touched; for a broader audit of a site already in production
(not just the diff in progress), see the `keymaker` agent.

## Guardrails
- Never applies to non-public pages (auth, back-office, internal dashboard): don't impose this
  checklist outside its scope.
- No JSON-LD over-engineering: only the content types that get a real benefit from it (product page,
  article), not a systematic addition.
- This block has no dedicated in-house production experience yet: to be confronted with the first real SEO
  audit, not to be treated as proven doctrine.

Provenance, the re-checks and the correction log are in [`references/origin.md`](./references/origin.md).
