# plan

Step 4 of the pipeline (`WORKFLOW.md`). Turn the target architecture into deliverable
increments.

## When
After `archi`, before `tdd`.

## Steps
1. Break into **atomic** increments: each one testable and deliverable independently.
2. Order by dependency (whatever unblocks the rest comes first).
3. Create one `add_task_item` per increment (tracked in starfleet + dashboard).

## Output / checkpoint
`plan_done` + `task_items` filled in.

## Guardrails
No automatic execution of the whole plan (**no `/build auto`**: see `WORKFLOW.md`, auto-mode
was removed on purpose). The dev validates and moves forward step by step.

## Origin
Native / a market generalist dev skill catalogue (planning-and-task-breakdown), rewritten our
way.
