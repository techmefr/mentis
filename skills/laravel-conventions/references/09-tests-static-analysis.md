# laravel-conventions §9 — Tests and static analysis

> Section 9 of `skills/laravel-conventions`. Read it when tests are written, or Larastan/Pint is in play. The other sections and the guardrails stay in `SKILL.md`.

1. **Two tiers, and no third.** A **feature test** boots the framework and asserts an observable outcome —
   a row written, a job dispatched, a notification sent, a response returned. A **unit test** covers code you
   wrote yourself with non-trivial logic and no framework coupling: a money converter, a period value object,
   a working-hours calculator. There is no "integration", "controller" or "service" folder; if something
   doesn't fit the two, the test is aimed at the wrong thing.
2. **The default is the feature test**, and the reason is economic: one factory call plus one assertion on the
   dispatched job covers the model hook, the listener registration and the payload at once — and it's written
   against the contract, so it survives the refactor. The framework's own Eloquent, router and queue are
   already tested; a test that mocks the database to prove a listener was wired proves only that you wrote a
   mock.
3. **The routing is mechanical**, which is the point — nobody should debate it: a model lifecycle side effect,
   an HTTP endpoint, a console command, a listener or job `handle()`, a notification or mail, a policy, a
   scope/accessor/mutator → **feature**. A pure custom domain piece → **unit**.
4. **Arrange / Act / Assert, with exactly one Act.** One action means one reason to fail; two Act blocks are
   two tests sharing a name. Name the method after the **behaviour**, not the method called —
   `it_marks_invoice_paid_when_payment_succeeds`, never `it_marks_paid`.
5. **Assert observable outcomes, never internal calls.** `shouldReceive('save')->once()` asserts your own
   plumbing; the row, the response, the dispatched job and the sent mail are what the user experiences.
6. **Four anti-patterns with the same root**: instantiating a controller and calling its action (it bypasses
   middleware, the form request, route binding and the response contract); unit-testing a job or listener
   against a mocked database; booting the framework to test a calculator; and reaching for a mocking library
   in a unit test — if you need to mock a collaborator, the collaborator is framework-touching and the test
   belongs one tier up.
7. **One test style across the project**, applied uniformly — but **inside an existing file, match that
   file's local style**. Half-migrating a file between styles is worse than either style.
8. **Seeders and factories: no orphans.** Every foreign key resolved through a factory relationship or an
   explicit lookup, never a hardcoded id that happens to exist locally.
9. A factory produces a valid minimal object; the test states what it needs on top. A factory that fabricates
   a fully-populated aggregate makes every test depend on data it never asked for.
10. Reference data inserted by a migration or a seeder is idempotent — it runs again on the next environment.
11. Where a static analyser is installed, detect its configured level on the first edit and **write to that
   level**, rather than introducing findings someone else has to clear. Its baseline is not a licence to add
   to the baseline.
12. Beware a factory whose model has a lifecycle listener performing an outbound call: the test needs that
   call faked, or the suite makes real network requests and fails for reasons that look like flakiness.
