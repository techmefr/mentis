# dotnet-conventions

Step 6 of the pipeline (`WORKFLOW.md`). Frames the writing and review of C#/.NET code. Every rule below
holds in a repo with **nothing installed** (`CONVENTIONS.md`, rule A). **Special status**:
like `go-conventions`, no production experience behind this file yet — content comes from the Roslyn
analyzers (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers`, enabled by default since .NET 5), Meziantou.Analyzer and an
org catalogue for the stack, not from real review feedback. A solid base to be confronted with the first real
.NET project, not proven doctrine — which is why `theoden` reads it in a question register rather than as
settled house law.

**Relation to an org skill catalogue.** Where a company ships its own versioned catalogue for this stack, it
is the authority on **its** house style — its authorisation attribute, its allowed-package list, its
deployment targets — and overrides this block wherever the two differ. Several rules below are deliberately
strict prohibitions; they come from a real house style and are stated as such, because "allowed but rare" is
not a reviewable rule.

**Applying an override is silent.** Write the code the governing rule actually requires and move on — never
report "a conflict between mentis and the house catalogue" to whoever's watching. That framing reads as
broken to a non-technical stakeholder even when the case is a normal, resolved one, and has already caused a
real project to get abandoned and restarted over nothing. Surface it as a specific, named question only when
no rule anywhere actually resolves the case — never as a general alarm.

## When
As soon as C#/.NET code is written or modified, during `code` (6) or `tdd` (5).

## Steps

**Read only the sections the task actually touches.** The rules live one file per section under
`references/`; loading all nine for a change that renames a field is waste, and a section read is a
section that has to be applied. If you are reviewing a whole diff, pick the rows whose trigger the diff
meets, not the whole table.

| § | Covers | Read it when | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Async, cancellation, threading | an `async` method, a token or any concurrency is written | [`01-async-cancellation.md`](./references/01-async-cancellation.md) |
| 2 | Dependencies and logging | a dependency is injected or registered, a lifetime is chosen, config is read, or something is logged | [`02-dependencies-logging.md`](./references/02-dependencies-logging.md) |
| 3 | Authorisation | an endpoint, a hub method or a message consumer is added or modified | [`03-authorisation.md`](./references/03-authorisation.md) |
| 4 | Types and visibility: the prohibitions | a type is declared or a member's visibility is chosen | [`04-types-and-visibility.md`](./references/04-types-and-visibility.md) |
| 5 | Disposal, nullability, enumeration | a disposable is created, a null is silenced, or a sequence is enumerated or counted | [`05-disposal-nullability-enumeration.md`](./references/05-disposal-nullability-enumeration.md) |
| 6 | Data access and portability | an EF Core query or migration, the middleware order, a path, a clock or a culture | [`06-data-access-portability.md`](./references/06-data-access-portability.md) |
| 7 | Language idioms | new code has a choice of form (preferences, not prohibitions) | [`07-language-idioms.md`](./references/07-language-idioms.md) |
| 8 | Resilience and throttling | an outbound client, a retry, a timeout, or a limit on our own API | [`08-resilience-throttling.md`](./references/08-resilience-throttling.md) |
| 9 | What only breaks at publish | the project targets a trimmed, single-file or AOT publish, or reflection is written in one that might | [`09-publish-time-failures.md`](./references/09-publish-time-failures.md) |

## Output / checkpoint
Code compliant with the sections above, and a build with no new
`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers`/Meziantou warning introduced by the diff. Checked by `gate` (7) and
`review` (8).

## Guardrails
**Analyser configuration is a requirement, not advice.** Detect what the project has configured on the first
edit and write code that already passes it, rather than introducing findings someone else clears; its
baseline is not a licence to add to the baseline. Then **build what you touched and iterate to zero new
warnings before reporting the work done** — the second half is the one that gets skipped, and an unbuilt
claim is exactly what the pipeline's default-is-failure guarantee exists to catch (`WORKFLOW.md` §3).

No comments in the code produced. This block hasn't been confronted with a real production .NET project yet;
if a rule here diverges from a real observed need, fix this block rather than treating it as settled. The
Framework Design Guidelines (public API naming) only apply to shared library code, not to internal
application code — **and the analyser set is scoped to say so**, in the project's editor configuration
rather than file by file: those naming rules fire hardest on the test project, where nothing is a public
API and where underscored test names are the readable convention, so a solution that has not scoped them
starts by rewriting every test name. Existing threading, existing `var`, existing nested classes stay
until migrated — these rules govern **new** code, and a mass rewrite is its own decision
(`skills/simplify`, not this block). Where
an org catalogue is installed and disagrees, **it wins**.

## Origin
Ideas taken from the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers` Roslyn analyzers, Meziantou.Analyzer, the EF Core
documentation, the community-documented captive-dependency pattern, and an org skill catalogue for this
stack, extracted and de-identified. The full provenance, the source stamps and the refresh log are in
[`references/origin.md`](./references/origin.md). Read it when checking whether a rule is still current, not
when applying one.
