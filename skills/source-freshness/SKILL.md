name: source-freshness
description: Use when a block states a fact taken from outside this repo — a framework API, a version-specific convention, a regulatory deadline — or when refreshing one against the current upstream docs. Defines the stamp, the expiry, and the marker for anything asserted from memory rather than read.

# source-freshness

Cross-cutting (`WORKFLOW.md` §2), meta: it governs this repo's own content. A block whose facts have
gone stale is worse than a missing block, because it's followed with confidence. Nothing about it looks
wrong.

The two failure shapes are different and both are silent:
- **A version-pinned fact drifts** — an API that changed, a convention that a framework major reversed.
- **A dated fact moves** — a deadline everybody had memorised is amended. The AI Act's high-risk
  obligations were "2 August 2026" in every summary written before mid-2026, and were deferred to
  2 December 2027 by an amendment published in the Official Journal. Any block that had hardcoded the
  first date without a source now reads as authoritative and is wrong.

## When
When writing or revising a block that states an external fact; when a project bumps a framework major;
when a regulatory change is announced; and as part of a `maintaining-blocks` audit.

## Steps

### 1. Stamp what came from outside
1. In `Origin`, name the **source and the version or date read** — not "the framework docs" but which
   version, and when it was read.
2. **A fact with no source is a fact from memory.** Mark it `[verify]` inline. That marker is not
   decoration: it's the difference between "we read this" and "the model produced something plausible",
   and only the first one survives a disagreement.
3. **`[verify]` is a debt, not a state to live in.** It's allowed while writing; a block shipped with
   one is an admission nobody checked.

### 2. Give the fact an expiry
1. **Version-pinned facts** (a convention block for a framework) expire when the pinned major changes.
   State the version in the block, so the mismatch is visible to whoever reads it in a repo on a
   different one.
2. **Dated facts** (a deadline, a regulation state) carry the date they were verified, and a window
   after which they're treated as unverified.
3. **Past its window, the fact is unverified, not wrong.** The block says so at the top rather than
   being deleted — half the value is knowing something needs re-reading.
4. Do this per fact, not per block. One stale deadline shouldn't discredit forty rules that don't
   depend on it.

### 3. Refresh against the real docs, not from memory
1. **Fetch the current documentation** for the pinned version and re-read the sections the block asserts
   things about. Refreshing from memory reproduces the drift you're trying to remove.
2. **Where available, use a documentation retrieval tool** — `context7` is the one wired here: it pulls
   current library documentation on demand, which is exactly what a training cutoff can't give you.
   See `references/README.md` for the wiring.
3. **Diff against what the block says**, and change only what actually moved. A refresh that rewrites
   the block's whole voice loses the parts that were ours.
4. **Update the stamp even when nothing changed.** "Re-verified, unchanged" is the most useful outcome
   and the one most often left unrecorded.
5. **When the source is a closed, named enumeration** (the Gang of Four's 22 patterns, OWASP's Top 10, a
   linter's rule list, WCAG's success criteria) — don't refresh by re-reading the block's prose and
   asking "does this still sound right". Fetch the enumeration itself and give **every item on it** an
   explicit verdict against the block: covered under this heading, subsumed by the framework/language
   (say which), deliberately out of scope (say why), or a genuine gap to close. A prose refresh can miss
   an item quietly; an enumeration refresh can't, because there's nothing left to check once every item
   has a verdict. This is what made the design-patterns/security-hardening/react-nextjs-conventions
   re-checks on 2026-08-10 findable rather than another confidence pass — the list itself is the checklist,
   not something to reconstruct from memory each time.

### 4. Rule B still applies to the fresh source
1. **Read the docs, then write our rule.** A block that quotes upstream at length isn't a convention,
   it's a mirror that rots.
2. **Never make a pipeline step depend on a documentation service at runtime.** Rule B exists so nobody
   upstream can break our workflow: a retrieval tool being down must degrade to "the block is as fresh
   as its stamp", never to a blocked step.
3. That's the whole boundary: **authoring-time it's a source, runtime it's a dependency.** These blocks
   are text files that work offline, and that property is not negotiable for a convenience.

## Output / checkpoint
No pipeline checkpoint. What it owes: every external fact carrying a source and a version-or-date, no
un-marked memory claims, expiries stated, and refreshed blocks stamped with the date they were
re-verified — including when nothing changed.

## Guardrails
- **Never state a deadline, a version number or a threshold without a source.** These are the facts most
  confidently remembered and most often amended.
- **Never remove a `[verify]` marker without doing the verifying.**
- **Never let a refresh become a rewrite.** The upstream doc is the fact; the rule around it is ours.
- **Never add a runtime dependency on an external docs service.** Authoring-time only.
- Where a fact turns out to be jurisdiction- or edition-specific, say which one it holds for rather than
  generalising it (see `business/regulatory-watch`).

## Origin
Two ideas taken from Anthropic's `claude-for-legal` plugin suite and rewritten: the **freshness gate**
(bundled reference content tracks a verification window and warns at invocation) and the **`[verify]`
tag** (citations from model knowledge alone are flagged, as opposed to those pulled through a research
connector). Both were built for legal reference material; the same mechanism applies unchanged to
framework conventions, which is why this block is cross-cutting rather than legal.

What's ours: the per-fact rather than per-block granularity, the "unverified, not wrong" treatment past
the window, and the authoring-time-versus-runtime boundary that lets us use a docs retrieval service
without breaking rule B. Verified 2026-08-06 against the linked repository's README.
