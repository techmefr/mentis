# bug-triage

Entry point into the `debug` support step (`WORKFLOW.md` §2, between 6 and 7), and the piece that was
missing:
`debug` starts from a failing case you can run. A report is not that. It's a sentence, sometimes a video,
usually without the version, the account or the time.

Two things go wrong without this step. Someone starts debugging a guess at the problem. Or the report is
closed as "cannot reproduce" when the missing piece was one question away.

## When
As soon as a bug comes from outside the people who wrote the code: support, a customer, a colleague, a
project manager, a test session. One report, one pass through this skill.

For a queue rather than one report — a support inbox, an error tracker, a recurring bug channel — this
is the pipeline entry the market calls a proactive/time-based loop: wire native `/loop` (or `/schedule`
for a fixed cadence) to run this skill on each new item unattended, still one ticket per bug (§3.4), still
one human told per outcome. The triage logic doesn't change; only who presses the button does.

## Steps

### 1. Extract the facts from the report before answering it
1. **Read what's attached before asking anything.** A screen recording usually contains the URL, the
   account, the exact input and the error text — everything the reporter forgot to type. Extracting frames
   plus a transcript locally turns a video into readable evidence (see `Origin` for tooling); a screenshot
   gets read, not skimmed.
2. **Separate observation from interpretation.** "The save button does nothing" is an observation; "the API
   is down" is the reporter's theory, and it's evidence about their mental model, not about the system.
3. **Then ask only for what's genuinely missing**: when, which account or role, which environment and
   version, what they expected instead. One round of precise questions beats three of vague ones.
4. **Check the logs and error tracker for that time window** — often the actual error is already there,
   and the report only told you where to look.

### 2. Get to a reproduction, or record precisely why not
1. **Reproduce on the same conditions**: same role and permissions, same data shape, same environment.
   Most "works for me" outcomes are a permission or a data-state difference (`qa-exploratory-testing`).
2. **Write the reproduction as steps someone else can follow**, with the expected and actual result.
   That's the artefact `debug` needs and the one a regression test gets written from.
3. **When it won't reproduce, say what you tried** — conditions, versions, accounts. "Cannot reproduce"
   with no list is not a finding, and it puts the burden back on someone who already gave you what they
   had.
4. **Intermittent is a fact, not a failure to reproduce.** Note the frequency and look for the shared
   condition (time, concurrency, cache, a specific record) rather than closing it.

### 3. Decide what it is, and route it
1. **Severity is about impact, not about difficulty**: data wrong or lost, a blocked user with no
   workaround, a security or privacy consequence, or an annoyance. Data and security consequences go up
   immediately, not into a backlog.
2. **A privacy or security consequence stops being a bug ticket** and follows
   `business/data-protection` and `business/incident-communication` — including the honest statement about
   affected data.
3. **Not a bug is a legitimate outcome**: intended behaviour, a support/documentation problem, a feature
   request. Say which, and say what happens instead of the fix.
4. **One ticket per bug**, with the reproduction, the evidence and nothing else in it.
5. **Tell the reporter what you concluded.** A report that disappears silently teaches people to stop
   reporting, and that cost never shows up in a metric.

### 4. Hand over
1. To `debug` with: the reproduction, the evidence, the observed-versus-expected, and the window in which
   it happened.
2. **Regression test first** where the doctrine allows it (`tdd`): the reproduction is already the test
   case, which is the cheapest test you'll ever write.
3. **Note the workaround** if one exists — for the reporter now, and for whoever gets the same report
   tomorrow.

## Output / checkpoint
A reproduction someone else can run, or an explicit list of what was tried and what's still missing;
severity with its reason; a route (fix now, backlog, escalate, not-a-bug); and the reporter told. Nothing
reaches `debug` without a runnable case or a stated blocker.

## Guardrails
- **Never start debugging before you can reproduce or have named what's missing.** Debugging a guess is
  the expensive failure this step prevents.
- **Never close a report as irreproducible without listing what you tried.**
- **Never adopt the reporter's diagnosis** as the starting point; take their observations.
- Never handle a report containing personal data by copying it around — a screenshot in a ticket is a
  disclosure with a wide audience (`business/data-protection` §3.4).
- **Never rewrite the report's original description**: attachments and embedded media are lost that way,
  and they were the evidence. Add, don't replace.

## Origin
The video-evidence step in §1.1 comes from a family of community Claude skills that make a video readable
by an agent — scene-change frame extraction with deduplication plus a subtitle-or-Whisper transcript,
running entirely locally on `ffmpeg` (`claude-real-video`, `watch-video-skill` and similar, MIT). We take
the *idea* and name the tool as optional: it's local, so using it breaks no rule, and a block that
required it would (`source-freshness` §4.2). Reviewed 2026-08-06. The queue framing in `## When` is
native Claude Code (`/loop`/`/schedule`, proactive loops), invoked, not reimplemented.

Everything else is ours, and mostly comes from repeated experience: observation versus the reporter's
theory, "cannot reproduce" needing its own evidence list, intermittent treated as a fact, severity by
impact rather than difficulty, one ticket per bug, and never overwriting the original description because
that deletes the attached media.
