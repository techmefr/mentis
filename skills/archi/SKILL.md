# archi

Step 3 of the pipeline (`WORKFLOW.md`). The step that **avoids duplicates**: agreeing on the
target architecture by looking at the real code.

## When
After `spec`, before `/PLAN`. Systematic as soon as we touch shared code or an existing domain.

## Steps
1. Run **graphify** on the worktree(s) concerned → a graph of what exists.
2. **Dedup pass, before deciding anything.** Search on *what the thing does*, not on what you'd
   name it: your name for it is exactly the name the existing one doesn't have, which is why
   duplicates get written by people who did look first.
   1. List the **capabilities** the feature needs, in domain words ("filter a list by agency",
      "format a duration", "resolve the current tenant"), one line each.
   2. For each one, search three ways, because each misses what the others catch: by **name**
      (the obvious synonyms), by **signature/shape** (the types going in and out), and by **call
      site** (who would already need this — search the consumers, not the producer).
   3. Read the candidates you find. A near-match is a decision, not a miss: either it covers the
      need (reuse it), or it covers 80% (extend it, and say what the extension is), or the
      difference is real (create, and write down why the existing one doesn't fit).
   4. **Record the negative result too.** "Searched for X as name/shape/callers, found nothing"
      is the evidence that justifies creating. Without it, "there was nothing" is a claim, and
      the duplicate that shows up in review had a findable original.
3. Decide **where the feature plugs in** (reuse vs create), note the extension points.
4. Write the target architecture via **`set_arch_node`** (file / role / `planned` status).

## Output / checkpoint
`arch_done` + architecture nodes filled in (living documentation), and for each capability either
the existing thing being reused or the recorded reason it couldn't be.

## Guardrails
Extracting shared code = **a coordinated refactor, a human decision**: don't refactor quietly
inside an isolated worktree. If a duplicate already exists, flag it, don't recreate it.

Two failure modes to name explicitly. **Creating because searching was inconclusive**: an ambiguous
search result means read the code, not assume it's absent. And **reusing something that only looks
right**: bending an existing helper to a need it wasn't built for produces a shared thing that's
wrong for both callers, which is worse than the duplicate. Reuse is the default, not an obligation.

## Origin
Internal (graphify) + convergence of several market skill authors (architecture before build),
rewritten. The three-way dedup search (name, shape, call site) and the requirement to record the
negative result are ours: "I looked and found nothing" was the step that kept producing duplicates,
because searching by the name you already chose can only find things that share your vocabulary.
