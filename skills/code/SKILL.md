# code

Step 6 of the pipeline (`WORKFLOW.md`). Build the minimum that makes each test pass.

## When
After `tdd` (red tests written), during `/BUILD`.

## Steps
0. **Climb the ladder before writing**, after reading the task and the code it touches. Stop at the first
   rung that holds: does the need exist at all; is it already in this repo; does the standard library
   do it; does the platform do it natively; does a dependency already installed do it; can it be one line;
   only then the minimum code. The ladder shortens the solution, never the reading. It never removes input
   validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security measures or
   accessibility basics.
1. Take **one** `task_item`, write the minimum code that makes its test pass.
2. Run that test scoped, per `skills/run-generated-tests` — the new/changed test, at widest the file
   it lives in, never the project's bare full-suite command. `toggle_task_item` when the increment is
   done, commit.
3. Blocked / unexpected error → invoke the **`debug`** block before proposing a fix.
4. Repeat until the `task_items` are exhausted.

## Output / checkpoint
`build_done`.

## Guardrails
**No comments in the code.** **Never** mark a test `passes: true` by hand, the **GATE**
(step 7) decides, on evidence. We don't validate ourselves.

**A failing test gets the implementation fixed, never the test loosened.** Editing a pre-existing test
file is for adding the case this task's new behaviour actually introduces, never for deleting, loosening
or retargeting an assertion that was already there to make it match what the code currently does — that
specific move is how a regression ships behind a green suite (see `debug` §3.4/Guardrails for the full
statement, and route through `tdd`/`dozer` if the test itself is genuinely the thing that's wrong).

## Origin
Native Claude Code + internal, rewritten. The no-test-tampering guardrail added 2026-08-11, same change
as `debug`/`tdd` and the implementer agents: named directly by the operator, not sourced from a
catalogue.

The ladder (step 0) is rewritten from the `ponytail` skill (MIT), read 2026-10-02. Its marker comment, debt ledger and benchmark figures are not carried over: comments are forbidden here and the author's numbers are not measured on this repo.
